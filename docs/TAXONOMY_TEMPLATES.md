## 1. The Blueprint (The Plan)
*Templates differ from Canvases in that they deal with **Content Patterns**, not just spatial slots.*

*   **Consistency:** "A Product Page Template should be equal for all products."
*   **Reusability:** A Template is a reusable configuration of Widgets.
*   **State:** Templates often manage the state between tokens (e.g., a "Logged In Dashboard" vs. "Public Dashboard").

### 1.1 Strategic Value (The Inventory)
*Defining this inventory is crucial before building the Design System.*
*   **Scope Definition:** This list constitutes the "Requirements Document" for the Widgets layer.
*   **Reality Check:** By mapping templates first, we ensure we build Widgets for real user needs, not abstract theories.
