Phidelity

Golden Ratio as the core math. Spacing, typography, layout and even color are derived from 1.618. This enforces visual harmony by design.

Ultra-granular column counts. Column grids like 26, 50, 74, 98 provide maximum flexibility while remaining structured and modular, like a lego-system.

Container queries-first. Entirely built on container queries, not viewport-based breakpoints. This allows layout decisions to be made at the component level, enabling horizontal growth and layout independence.

Horizontal mounting of content. Components can shift from vertical to horizontal when there’s space, ideal for editorial or dashboard-style layouts.

Precision and math over approximation. Uses relative units and calc() to express exact relationships — not just pixels or approximated values.

Spatial adaptation > responsive design. Built with modern CSS capabilities in mind (like container queries and post-CSS Grid thinking) to adapt to spatial contexts, not just screen widths.
