          <phi-article-text-only id="origin" title="Origin" summary="How Phidelity evolved">
            <p>I have been obsessing over Phi, «the golden ratio», 1:1.618, for years. In 2023, as I was nerding out in
              my
              cabin in Denmark, the land of LEGO, it suddenly occurred to me, that I could make a grid using only Phi
              rectangles, like stacked little LEGO blocks. </p>

            <h3>Visual thinking</h3>
            <p>When I put the blocks next to each other, horizontally, I realized that I had come across a simple idea
              for both grid columns and spaces between columns. No need for arbitrary gaps, gutters and margins. Only
              Phi rectangles were necessary. Stacking them vertically gave me grid rows naturally.</p>

            <h3>Counting columns</h3>
            <p>When I started adding these rectangles in Figma, I discovered that a count of 13 would be a 12 column
              grid (1 extra column added for margin). 26 rectangles would also give me 12 columns, only with 2
              rectangles in stead for each column and gap. So I continued this 24+2 pattern with 50, 74, 98, 122, 146,
              and so on - they all gave me 12 columns, but each with more width and granular resolution.</p>

            <h3>Fibonacci in Figma</h3>
            <p>Using a rectangle in Figma that was 13x8 pixels (both Fibonacci numbers), this gave me each break point;
              13 columns = 169px. 26 columns = 338px. 50 columns = 650px. 74 columns = 962px. And so on. However,
              realizing that the 13x8px rectangle is not precise enough (1:1.625), I understood that I needed to use
              math to get closer to nature’s divine ratio. </p>
          </phi-article-text-only>
        </div>
        <div class="zone">
          <phi-article-bottom-image id="natures-math" title="Nature's Math" summary="Enter the CSS Grid"
            image="assets/images/sunflower.jpg">
            <p>When I used CSS grid to divide any width by one of my column numbers (13, 26, 50, 74, 98, 122, 146, etc),
              I could calculate the grid columns automatically. Since the shorter part of a golden ratio rectangle is
              the long part divided by 1.618, I was able to use math and ‘grid-auto-rows’ to get the golden ratio grid
              mesh I wanted. Exactly the same as in Figma, only that in the browser, it was dynamically adjusting to any
              width. And mathematically correct.
            </p>

            <h3>Coordinates</h3>
            <p>The Phidelity grid mesh is a canvas «map of divine coordinates» to align design elements against, for
              natural distribution and growth. When I set up the break points I had discovered in Figma, I got a very
              fluid transition between the grid column counts; 25 - 50 - 74 - 98 - 122 - 146. It was satisfying to see
              how symmetrical partitions of the width (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, etc) flow almost unnoticably through the different
              break points, as the canvas width expands.</p>

            <h3>Unlimited design</h3>
            <p>Using CSS grid coordinates, I realized that practically all designs were now possible through css grid
              start rows / columns and end rows / columns. Even overlapping layers present no challenge. Power was
              returned to the designer.</p>

          <phi-article-bottom-image id="container-queries" title="Container Queries" summary="Responsive content"
            caption="The themes growth and adaptability are crucial for a responsive design. Like the succulent plant in the image, Phidelity can grow and adapt to any width, while maintaining its natural shape and proportions.">
            <p>CSS frameworks like Tailwind, Bootstrap and Foundation all use Media Queries to adapt to different screen
              sizes. These traditional systems have the viewport as their responsive outlet; desktop, tablet and mobile
              screens. </p>
            <h3>Parents in charge</h3>
            <p>Phidelity takes a different approach, and enables the newer and more refined container queries take
              control. Container queries allow the parent container to decide how its children should behave. </p>

            <h3>Content adapts</h3>
            <p>The result is that we can design and develop solutions that have a much more flexible composition and
              behavior. Using the Phidelity mesh we can forget pixels when designing and coding. We can concentrate on
              making the content grow and shrink naturally from content break point to content break point. The limit is
              now literally the designer’s creativity.

            <h3>Semantic elements</h3>
            <p>First we draw the big outlines of Semantic elements. Typically Header, Left navigation, Main Area,
              Aside/right navigation and footer. All using CSS Grid. These areas can be both based on fixed or dynamic
              sizing (or both). For example, the left navigation can be set in pixels, while the main area can be set in
              fractions.</p>

            <h3>Sections</h3>
            <p>Second, within the Main Area we go on to outline the Sections. Typically some large Zones with Content
              Blocks. These can flow and restack themselves in different ways as the width of the Main Area increases.
              All using fractions, pixels or rem and container queries.</p>

            <h3>Widgets</h3>
            <p>Third, we design the content for each block.
              Inside the widget, we meet the true responsive magic of Phidelity: The calculated golden ratio mesh.
              Designers can now draw on a much larger and more flexible canvas. Horizontally and vertically, utilising
              the large screens people have, as well as the mobile displays. Using the mesh we can forget pixels when
              designing and coding. We can concentrate on making the content grow naturally from break point to break
              point.</p>

            <p>Designing in three spatial levels, we first mark the elementary zones and Semantic regions using
              fractions. Then using more fractions to split up the main areas into Sections to see how these big zones
              may resize, move and reflow on big screens. Then finally zooming in on the content widgets which all get
              their size by their parent container width, not by the browser viewport. We use the perfectly granular
              mesh for all sizing and spacing.</p>

            <h3>No more pixels</h3>
            <p>Using the mesh we can forget pixels when designing and coding. We can concentrate on making the content
              grow naturally from break point to break point.</p>
