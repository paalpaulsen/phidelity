# Veo Prompts: The Digital Vehicle

**Aesthetic Style:**
*   **Background:** Infinite pristine white studio.
*   **Hardware:** Photorealistic Apple-style devices (iPhone 16 Pro, iPad Pro, Pro Display XDR) floating in mid-air.
*   **UI Style:** Extremely minimal, flat, clean "Uber-style" graphics. High contrast black text on white.
*   **Key Feature:** **"The Pattern"** - Fine, technical cyan/golden lines (The Grid) visible **ONLY inside the UI Widgets**, revealing their internal structure. The space between widgets (The Layout) is clean.
*   **Lighting:** Soft, diffused high-key lighting. No harsh shadows. Premium Tech Commercial look.

## Scene 1: The Box Model (Abstract)
**Prompt:**
> Cinematic high-angle shot, white background. Hundreds of translucent glass boxes of varying aspect ratios are floating and gently colliding in a physics simulation. They stack vertically and horizontally. The boxes are simple and elegant. Soft ambient occlusion shadows. 4k resolution, photorealistic.

## Scene 2: The Structure (Organizing)
**Prompt:**
> Side profile macro shot of a sleek glass Apple Pro Display XDR. On screen: The floating boxes snap into a rigid, organized layout. First, large "Header" and "Footer" blocks lock into place. Then, a "Main" content block fills the center. Finally, smaller "Widget" blocks populate the main area. Thin cyan grid lines appear underneath each block as it snaps, revealing the hidden structure. White background.

## Scene 3: Flexibility (Responsive)
**Prompt:**
> Close up shot of an iPhone 15 Pro floating in white space. The screen shows a simple minimalist Card UI widget. The phone rotates 90 degrees to landscape mode. The Card UI smoothly fluidly reshapes itself.
> **Critical Detail:** Inside the Card Widget, a dense **26-column cyan grid** glows faintly, showing the text alignment. The white background *outside* the card stays clean. Smooth motion.

## Scene 4: The Factory (Ingredients)
**Prompt:**
> Top-down view of a pristine white workbench. Invisible hands assembling a digital UI Widget like a Lego set. A "Text Box", an "Image Box", and a "Chart Box" slide into a container.
> **Critical Detail:** As each part lands inside the container, a fine **50-column golden grid** appears momentarily *on the surface of the widget* to show perfect fit. Apple design aesthetic.

## Scene 5: The Metaphor (Vehicle)
**Prompt:**
> Split screen comparison. Left side: High-end 3D animation of a car engine being assembled from floating parts (pistons, gears). Right side: A digital "Widget" being assembled from UI parts (Buttons, Icons). Both sides move in perfect sync. White background. Clean, laboratory feel.

## Scene 6: The Ingredients (Tokens)
**Prompt:**
> Macro zoom into a specific "Button" on a UI screen. The button surface dissolves to reveal the wireframe structure underneath. Deep inside, we see glowing mathematical formulas and numbers ($4.2M, 1.618) floating in the grid structure. This represents the "Tokens" (DNA). The numbers glow with a warm golden light.

## Scene 7: The Assembly (The Map)
**Prompt:**
> Wide shot of a massive Apple Pro Display XDR. The screen displays a "World Map" flat style. Instead of countries, the map is made of UI Widgets perfectly interlocked. A cursor drags a new "Widget" from a sidebar folder labeled "Library" and drops it into an empty slot on the map.
> **Critical Detail:** The map itself has no grid, but the *inside* of the Widget lights up with a **74-column cyan grid** as it snaps into place.

## Scene 8: Control & Branding (The Bridge)
**Prompt:**
> Close up of a generic gray UI button on an iPad screen. A file icon labeled "THE BRIDGE" floats onto the screen and merges with the button. The button instantly transforms: It becomes a vibrant Brand Red, the corners become rounded, and a drop shadow appears. The transformation is magical and smooth. White background studio.

## Scene 9: The Goal (Final Product)
![Scene 9 Style Frame](/Users/ppaulsen/Phidelity/docs/images/storyboard_scene_09_v3.png)
**Prompt:**
> Fast montage. A beautiful, complex Financial Dashboard UI functioning perfectly across three devices side-by-side: An iPhone, an iPad, and a MacBook Pro. All floating in white space.
> **Critical Detail:** The Dashboard uses a clean Macro Layout. Inside the specific Card Widgets (Chart, Data), we see the fine **98-column cyan grid lines** glowing effectively. The space *between* cards is empty whitespace.
> Text appears: "PHIDELITY".
