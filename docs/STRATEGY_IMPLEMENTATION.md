# Strategy: The Phidelity Implementation Model

**Philosophy:** Product over Consultancy. Prescriptive over Descriptive.

---

## 1. The Paradox of "User Needs"
In a traditional "Consultancy" project, we start with a blank sheet:
1.  **Discovery:** "What are your users' needs?" (3 Months)
2.  **Inventory:** "What content do you have?" (2 Months)
3.  **Construction:** "Build a system to fit specific content." (6 Months)
*   **Result:** A bespoke, expensive system that is hard to upgrade.

## 2. The Phidelity Approach: "Standard First"
As a White Label Product, Phidelity flips this model. We assume **80% of web content is universal**.
1.  **Deployment:** "Here is the standard system (The Taxonomy)." (Day 1)
2.  **Gap Analysis:** "Does your content fit our Article Template? If not, why?" (Week 1)
3.  **Exception Handling:** "We will build a custom 'Crisis Widget' for your specific gap." (Week 2)
4.  **Brand Injection:** "Apply your Tokens." (Week 3)

## 3. The Workflow
### Phase 1: The Audit (Mapping)
Instead of discovering content, we **map** existing content to Phidelity Templates.
*   *Client has "Company News"* -> Maps to **Section Page Template**.
*   *Client has "CEO Bio"* -> Maps to **Article Page Template**.
*   *Client has "Quarterly Report"* -> **No Match.** (Flag for Customization).

### Phase 2: The Ejection (Customization)
We only spend development effort on the "No Match" items.
*   **Benefits:** drastically reduced scope. We don't rebuild the Wheel (Hero, Footer, Nav); we only build the Engine Part that is unique.

### Phase 3: The Skinning (Tokens)
Once the content is mapped, we inject the **Brand Tokens**. The system suddenly "looks" like the client, despite being structurally identical to the White Label core.

## Summary
By auditing against a **Standard Inventory**, we turn the Design System project from a "Creative Exploration" into a "Migration Task". This is the only way to scale a White Label solution.
